# ‚ùå‚≠ïÔ∏è Tic Tac Toe made with Vue.js 

### A Tic Tac Toe game built with Vue.js (with vue-router & vuex) and deployed on Heroku

üëâ The project is hosted on Heroku here: https://tic-tac-toe--vuejs.herokuapp.com/#/
üôè Made thanks to a tutorial from Malt. The original repo here: https://github.com/nicolaspayot/vue-ttt-game/

# üìö Rules

* The game is played on a grid that's **3 squares by 3 squares**.
* The first player is **X**, the second player is **O** (both players are human).
* The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

# What I changed from the tutorial

* **added constraints**: 
-- when there is a winner, it is not possible to click on any other empty cell
-- when the player names are empty: the status component will still display "X" or "O" and not an empty string

* **changed the design**: changed colors, resized elements so that it fits smaller screens, added a logo
